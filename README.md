<h1 align="center"> Web based voice calculator to do mathematical operations. </h1>

* I used Web Speech API of javascript to record voice and then transferred input to *FLASK* with *AJAX*.
* I have used a library called numerizer to convert numerals into digits.

* #### You can perform the following mathematical operations:

  * Addition                    say: "Add 1 + 2" or "1 plus 2"
  * Subtraction                 say: "Subtract 10-5" or "10 minus 5" 
  * Multiplication              say: "10 multiplied by 5" or "multiply 10 and 5"
  * Division                    say: "10 divided by 5" or "divide 10 by 5"
  * Logarithms                  say: "log 2" or "log 2 base 10"
  * Square Root                 say: "square root of 4"
  * Factorial                   say: "Factorial of 5"
  * Exponent                    say: "2 raised 10" or "2 power 10"
